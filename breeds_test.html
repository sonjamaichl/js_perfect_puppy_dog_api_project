        <p>Thinking about getting a dog? But which one? When it comes to dogs, it is obvious that different breeds have different needs.
          Not only are they very different in size, but they also come with very different character traits that depend not only on the individual character of the dog, but largely on the breed.
          Some dogs have a very high level of energy and need a lot of physical exercise. Others can be sweet little couch potatoes who just want to go outside to do their business and sniff around a little bit.
          Some are high maintenance and need a lot of grooming because of their coaat length, others are more easy care.</p>
